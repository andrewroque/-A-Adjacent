Inquiry
How can we gain further mastery of the web browser as a design tool?
How do we create a transmedia work that can exist in several different forms?

Project Prompt
Create an online exhibition (micro-site) using your Browser Characteristic as a subject. The exhibition should exist online, but also create a printable artifact.

This exhibition can be a historical overview, could unearth some unknown aspect of the topic, be a conversation starter, a portrait, a comment, a critique, and should include documentation, work, information about the topic, and any other material that you find, collect, or create that expands our understanding of your subject.

Your online exhibition should include the following:
• A written curatorial concept/exhibition narrative 
• Include 5-10 works that explain or expand on your idea.
• A title and visual identity 
• The exhibition should exist as both a single page micro-site and a printable artifact (poster, checklist, flier, etc…a series (or serial printed piece) 

Questions:
How does your browser characteristic play a role in the design of this site?
How does an online exhibition translate to printed form? 
How can you use graphic design to mediate the work in your exhibition and inform viewers about your subject?

Step 1
Begin research (you should already have a head start with your blog). 
— Research your browser characteristics, study work that inhabits this space. Note and collect artifacts you could include in your exhibition.
— Prepare a short proposal (5-10 minutes) about your two exhibition concepts to show to class.
Your presentation should include:
1) A brief overview of your research into your Browser Characteristics.
2) 2 distinct curatorial concepts. A brief statement articulating the story you want to tell.
3) A collection of work you want to show in your exhibition (5-10)
